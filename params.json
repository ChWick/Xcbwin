{"name":"Xcbwin","tagline":"Xcbwin - a simple C++ class for graphical outputs using XCB","body":"### Xcbwin\r\nThe Xcbwin class is written for the Computational Physics Lecture given at the University of Wuerzburg (Germany). It provides rudimental and fast methods to produce simple graphical outputs.\r\nTo be a usefull tool for studens that are new to C++ the usage of the Xcbwin-class is very uncomplicated.\r\n\r\nCurrently the class provides methods to:\r\n$ Draw Lines, Points and Rectangles\r\n$ Change the color\r\n$ Handle keyboard events\r\n\r\nThe Xcbwin-class is based on the [Xwindow-class](http://www.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~hinrichsen/teaching/CP/Material/Quelltexte/xwindows) that was written using Xlib. \r\nXcbwin is designed to be downwardly compatible to the Xwindow-class, but uses [XCB](http://xcb.freedesktop.org/) (X protocol C-language Binding) which is designed to be a replacement for Xlib.\r\n\r\n### Current Development\r\nXcbwin is in a early phase of developement, although the basic methods seem to work quite reasonably.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributions\r\nContributions are always welcome!\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you have any trouble using this class, feel free to contact the author @jofalk.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
