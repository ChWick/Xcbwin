The Xcbwin class is written for the \"Computational Physics\" lecture given at the University of Wuerzburg (Germany). Hence it is designed to be easy to use even by students, that are new to C++. \r\n\r\nCurrently the class provides methods to:\r\n\r\n\r\n*  Draw Lines, Points and Rectangles\r\n*  Change the color\r\n*  Handle keyboard events\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Xcbwin-class is based on the [Xwindow-class](http://www.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~hinrichsen/teaching/CP/Material/Quelltexte/xwindows) that was written using Xlib. \r\nXcbwin is designed to be downwardly compatible to the Xwindow-class, but uses [XCB](http://xcb.freedesktop.org/) (X protocol C-language Binding) which is intended to be a replacement for Xlib in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIt's easy and almost self-explanatory how to use Xcbwin:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n#include \"xcbwin.h\"\r\nint main() {\r\n\r\nXcbwin Window;\r\nWindow.Open(400,400); //Opens a Window of size 400x400\r\nWindow.Black(); //Sets the drawing-color to black\r\nWindow.DrawRectangle(20,20,30,30); //Draws a Rectangle\r\nWindow.Wait(); // Waits for a keypress-event\r\nWindow.Close(); //Closes the Window\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a better example look at the \"demo\" folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Contributions\r\n\r\nIf you have some good ideas or suggestions how to improve the Xcbwin class please do not hesitate to fork the project or get in touch. \r\nCurrently the official Xcb-documentation is sometimes not very helpful. Hence a lot of the code was written by \"try and error\" and there are many flaws that need to be corrected. So even if you just have criticism please get in touch :-) .\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nXcblib is published under the MIT license.
